TODO Notes:

Got all the basework in place.
Old files are in the 'old' folders.

Waiting on symbolset fonts. After that everything else should go up pretty quickly.
Once all the styles are in place, I'll compile the less into a proper minified css doc.

After the initial completion of the pages, some tweaks will have to be made.
Off the top of my head, I still have to fix the hr's so that they stick under the images on the index page.

Various spacing adjustments are neede. Will complete that after all the pages are in place.
Doc's pages should fall right into place with just a few tweaks.

Also, metawork to be done. Descriptions, keywords, etc.

AlsoII -- Make a prettier favicon
