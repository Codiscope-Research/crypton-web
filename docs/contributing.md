# Contributing

We love it when people point out issues or submit pull requests! We have a small team right now and all help is appreciated.

The best way to get started is to fork the Crypton repository, get the [Diary example](https://github.com/SpiderOak/crypton/tree/master/client/examples/diary) running, and make sure all the tests pass for you.

If you do end up making a change, make sure your branch is clean, you've added tests for the change, they pass, and your code is in the same style as existing code.

If you have any problems, hit us up on [IRC or Twitter](/docs/support.html).
