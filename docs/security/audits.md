# Audits

Crypton has undergone two security audits. You can read about our philosophy regarding this [on the SpiderOak blog](https://blog.spideroak.com/20140220090004-responsibly-bringing-new-cryptography-product-market). It requires Crypton to:

* be independently verifiable it must be open source
* have a spec
* have a threat model
* have clear, well documented code
* be audited by security professionals with a crypto background

## Least Authority audit

Our first audit was concluded on December 20, 2013.

It focused on framework fundamentals, such as the use of SJCL and the container model. 5 vulnerabilities were discovered and subsequently patched.

## Leviathan Security Group audit

Our second audit was concluded on March 24, 2014.

It focused on the change of Crypton's authorization protocol to SRP. 19 issues were reported. Work is ongoing on tying up loose ends.
