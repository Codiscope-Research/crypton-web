# Support

If you run into any problems, have questions, or just want to talk to us, the best way is IRC. We are usually in `#crypton` on [OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/).

If you're really lazy, you can use the web chat by [clicking here](webchat.oftc.net/?channels=%23crypton). If you're more determined, you can [connect with your IRC client](http://www.oftc.net/).

You can also tweet at us [@crypton_io](https://twitter.com/crypton_io), but 140 characters is sometimes difficult to debug over...

If you need a more discrete channel, you can email use at `ddahl at spideroak dot com` or `cam at spideroak dot com`. We like getting signed email :)
