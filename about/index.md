      We believe in every user's right to privacy from all people, including service operators. This project is an attempt to democratize privacy in the context of application development.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past, the default application environment involved leaving plaintext information viewable by 3rd party servers. In many cases, this wasn't malicious - there simply hasn't been a simple option available. This has changed as Crypton now empowers companies and developers to realize zero knowledge environments out of the box. This is accomplished by transparently handling the complicated cryptography layers through Crypton and allowing developers to focus on domain specific challenges instead of figuring out how to push privacy and security after the fact.

      Many developers have previously been wary of the cloud as it once meant sacrificing privacy for convenience. But with Crypton, everyone can take full advantage of the cloud while enjoying the privacy and zero-knowledge that SpiderOak users have come to love.

    <h2>About SpiderOak</h2>

    <p>
      Since the beginning we have made a commitment to building privacy-oriented technologies. With privacy comes inherent challenges but we view all of these challenges as an opportunity to recommit to our core values. SpiderOak believes that everyone has the right to privacy.

      In the beginning, we were interested in dispelling the myth that once data went online it could no longer be private. It was more of an academic problem to solve than a commercial solution. Through this initial pursuit, the foundation of SpiderOak was laid. Ethan Oberman and Alan Fairless launched the company in 2007. The 'Zero-Knowledge' privacy cloud technology provider was born, offering a central, private place for data to live, free from surveilance by private and public entities. It was important to encompass all data, from Mac to Windows, Linux server to network volume regardless of size. Users are now empowered to share, sync and back up their data without compromising privacy.
