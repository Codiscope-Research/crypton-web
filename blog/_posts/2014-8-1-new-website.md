Crypton has a shiny new site! With over 500 stars on GitHub, a [Crypton-powered application in the wild](https://encryptr.org/), and [Edward Snowden name-dropping SpiderOak](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/17/edward-snowden-dropbox-privacy-spideroak), we figured it would be a good time to join the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

Along with working on mobile devices, we've completely rewritten the documentation and started a blog to post updates about Crypton and give ourselves a place to complain about things.

We're still working on stuff. All of the [code for the website is on GitHub](https://github.com/spideroak/crypton-web), including this blog, so if you find a typo or something doesn't work, feel free to open up an issue. We're also available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/crypton_io) and IRC (#crypton on [OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/)).
